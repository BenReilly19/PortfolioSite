                            <p><span class="image left"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/civility.png" alt="Civility image" /></span></span> Civility is a social networking app connecting people and their local politicians. I co-founded Civility with my close friend Evan Park, with the goal of connecting young people who want political change with the politicians who want to give it to them. We participated in the Life Changing Labs summer accelerator in 2021, which was an incredible experience for both myself and the project. Solving problems surrounding political discourse and governance in the United States is an issue that care deeply about, and Civility is an articulation of this passion.</p>
                            <p>For Civility, I primarily focused on the development of our application. Evan and I were able to build a team to work together on this project with expertise in software engineering, UX design, and business development. I gained invaluable experience operating as both an engineer and product manager, and had the opportunity to work full-time on the app's development. I was able to become a strong Javascript developer, having to learn mostly from scratch, and also develop my abilities to manage a team effectively.</p>
                            <p>You can learn more about Civility on our site <a href="https://www.civilityus.com">here at www.civilityus.com</a></p>

As the Business Lead of the Cornell ChemE Car team, my focus spans several fields. The role consists of guiding the business team to manage the team's finances, marketing, and IT. As the incoming business lead in the Spring of 2021, I directed the team's efforts towards Giving Day, the largest fundraising event of the year at Cornell University. I organized a Phone-A-Thon among members of the team, and was able to successfully raise over $4,000. </p>
							<p>Being a member of the Cornell ChemE Car team has given me hands-on insights into how large-scale engineering projects are managed and accomplished, from a financial and technical perspective.</p>

							<p>In the summer of 2020, I worked for the state of New York as a contact tracer during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the summer, I gained valuable experience calling COVID positive people, working in a high-stress environment and helping deliver aid to those who needed it most during the pandemic.</p>
                            <p>While at times this experience was stressful, it was incredibly meaningful to be able to help fight the COVID-19 virus, and keep the people of my home state informed and safe against the spreading pandemic.</p>
