                            <p>This is a website that I constructed for INFO 2300, intermediate design and programming for web. The website is built in PHP, and integrates a SQL database to keep track of the coffee reviews. The coffee reviews can be edited, added and deleted, if logged in with the proper credentials. If you want to check out the site, you can log in using username: orentheman and password: monkey. You can find the site <a href="https://glacial-lake-67071.herokuapp.com/">here.</a></p>
                            <p>Building this site was an incredibly challenging but worthwhile experience, and gave me the fundamental understanding of how to create interactive applications for the web.</p>

                                This was my final project for CS 2110, one of my favorite classes taken at Cornell University. For the final project, we were tasked with writing two searching algorithms to guide the character to their goal. The first algorithm finds the fastest path to the goal. My partner and I implemented Djikstra's algorithm to accomplish this. The second algorithm was much more complex, it required guiding the diver to the exit in a limited amount of steps, while also collecting the maximum amount of coins. The algorithm we created would compute the most profitable move after each coin was collected. </p>

My partner and I were able to earn an A+ on the assignment, and our score ended up ranking in the top 20 of a relatively large class, including the professors. This project gave me confidence as an engineer, and taught me to trust my intuition when attempting to find creative solutions to optimize difficult challenges.

							<h1 class="major">Biometric Data Analysis</h1>
							<p> <span class="image right"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/whoop.jpg" alt="Whoop Strap" /></span></span>For my final project in INFO 2950, Introduction to Data Science, I decided to analyze my own biometric data. This data was recorded via the Whoop 3.0 strap, which generated a dataset of about 6 months that I examine. The analysis was done entirely in Python, with the goal of determining both if Whoop's proprietary data metrics gave accurate insights into fitness, and if the product actually delivered on it's core promise: unlocking human performance. This project gave me a introduction to data science as a whole, and the course covered topics ranging from web scraping to machine learning.</p>
